    <title> Use For Loop </title>

<body>

    //For loops are used to increase the value by increasing the number one after the other or simply by turning one by one using a formula.

    <?php

    //For example, writing 1 to 100 requires a lot of coding as well as time. So the for loop is made in such a /way that one by one it is taken out or added and its specific value is printed.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    //If it is written from 1 to 100, then it will be as it is written below

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    // If it is written from 1 to 100, then it will be as it is written below

    // echo 1;
    // echo 2;
    // echo 3;
    // .......
    // echo 100;



    //So that requires a lot of time and a lot of code writing. From this we can easily diagnose it using for loop.
